# Twilio-Voicemail-Project
Please read the report for details


In this project, I have developed a code to record a voicemail and download it in mp3
format, which would then be uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket. This would allow us to generate a
link for that mp3 file which can further be used by anyone to download that mp3 file into their
system. Following are the steps involved in this project:

Step 1: Sign up for a number through Twilio.com and record a voicemail with it.

Step 2: Write a program to download the voicemail in mp3 format and then upload it to the
Amazon S3 bucket.

Step 3: Share the URL of the voicemail in the S3 bucket as a result.
